// Remastered's HUD frames, as frames the original game loads.
//
// A Remastered frame (GUIF) lists the same widgets as the disc's FRME, by the
// same names, laid out for a 16:9 screen and drawn with meshes of one model the
// frame names. The game's code finds its widgets by name and by worker id, so
// the disc's frame stays the skeleton: every widget of it is kept, and the ones
// Remastered also has take its transform, colour, draw mode and mesh. Widgets
// only Remastered has (trim, housings) are added under their parents; models
// only the disc has are emptied, their art having no place in the new layout.
//
// One frame becomes:
//   <FRME id>.FRME      the frame, in the disc's format, under the disc's id
//   <id>.CMDL           one model per mesh widget, unlit, one texture a surface
//   <id>.dds + .TXTR    each picture once: the native texture and its stub
//   <FRME id>.hudbars   the bars' strips (port_hud_bars.h)
// A tinted widget (SetTints) gets its own copy of each picture, multiplied by
// the tint: the game sets the widget's colour every frame, so the picture is
// the only place a constant factor can go.
//
// As with the model converter, bytes come and go through ConvertIO, and the
// output is the player's own, made from their copies of both games.
