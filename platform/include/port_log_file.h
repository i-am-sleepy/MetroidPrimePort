// The "write the log to a file" setting (F1 > System > Log, MP_LOG_FILE). Everything
// the process prints to stdout and stderr - the port's messages, Aurora's, SDL's,
// and the FATAL line Aurora prints right before it aborts - is also written to
// <user folder>/metroid_prime_port.log, so a crash on a machine without a
// terminal leaves a log to send. The previous run's log is kept as
// metroid_prime_port.old.log, so restarting after a crash does not lose it.
//
// The log is on by default (the logging=0 setting turns it off). Since it is meant to be
// attached to bug reports, the file has the user's home folder and account name
// taken out of it (port_log_redact.h).
//
// On Linux a small forked process copies a pipe to both the terminal and the file:
// it outlives an abort and drains everything already written. On Windows the same
// is done by a second copy of the program (RunCopy), to the file and to wherever
// stderr went before (console or redirect). On Android the logcat writers (PortLog, Aurora's
// callback, SDL) also call Write, each line straight to the file, and stdout and
// stderr are copied into logcat and the file; the log goes to the app's external
// folder (Android/data/org.metroidprime.port/files) unless the data was moved to
// shared storage, and a copy goes to
// Documents/MetroidPrime/metroid_prime_port.log, which the phone's file manager
// can open (it cannot browse Android/data since Android 13).
